# Gravity Switcher

A challenging 2D puzzle-platformer built with Python and Pygame. Navigate a maze by switching gravity to walk on walls and ceilings, collect orbs to unlock the exit, and avoid deadly spikes. The game combines physics-based movement with strategic puzzle-solving.

## Features
- **Gravity Switching**: Press the spacebar to cycle through four gravity directions (up, down, left, right).
- **Puzzle-Based Gameplay**: Collect all yellow orbs to unlock the green exit.
